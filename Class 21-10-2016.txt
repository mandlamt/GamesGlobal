Software Engineering Challenges

Quality assurance & maturity model - sSE started in 1968
-----------------------------------------------------




Who are the well kmown authors in the ICT industry 

ROOIFALk south Africa - the produced air craft in RSA - its documentation was heavier than the helicopter it self

Ad Hoc Approaches
-Enable flexibility - Agile

Formal Approaches
- Waterfall - excelent verification and product assurance

PRIMARY REASON FOR AGILE IS TO DO THINGS FASTER, documention and the software
In Agile software speaks for it self

THE PERCEPTION OF WATERFALL IS THAT:
- YOU have to document first
- you have to design first before you start developing
- and you cannot change things- which is nonese
- in waterfall you can untroduce change management, and allow for changes

Some Agile projects do not still provide value, time and cost

Agile is suitable to solve certain types of problems and waterfall/plan driven is still relevent in certain circumstances


------------ANTI AGILE MANIFASTO------------

---------The SEMAT Iniative------------------

-Against fashion and following new trends as they come in like Agile

Complex Adapti systems
----------------------

Book to read- Management 3.0 Leading Agile Developers and developing Agile leaders

THE CASM - Complex- Adaptive Situational Model

WITH AGILE in most cases there is no repositry of knowledge, it relies on people's existing knwoledge but it doesnt encourage knowledge retainment

ALL MODELS ARE WRONG, BUT MAY BE USEFUL


QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS
--------------------------

- Software Engineering must be regulated more formally
- Intangibility
- Technical Debt?
- Technical Dept is about minimising bugs and defects through documentation
- Agile - emraces technical debt by sayign we know that we're going to make mistakes


Conrtolled Quality Specification might be gud, but because the client only gets to see the product at the end they might not embrace the system and they might not want to use it

ISO 12207 - is the standard for software engineering processes
ISO 9126 - is the standard for quality product

Characteristict of software quality
-----------------------------------
1. Functionality -> Suitability
2. Reliability - maturity,fault taulerance, recoverability,reliability
3. Usability - understandability
4. Maintainability - changeability,testability
5. Profitability- 
6. Efficiency - 
7. 
8. 

There are two types of errors - expected and non-espected
Internet error 404 - is unexpected
