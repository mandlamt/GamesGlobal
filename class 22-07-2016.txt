PROCESS MODELS
---------------
CATEGORIES of process models
 	FORMAL PROCESSES - application must do exactly what is expected e.g Avation
 	PLAN DRIVEN - WATER FALL
        Agile


WATERFALL Model
---------------

Errors in requirements cost 50 to 200 more than coding errors

- Waterfall can work well with certain types of software, like embedded software that works with a machine
- Waterfall works well with applications where requirements are always the same and never change
- Its a life cycle Model

SPIRAL Model
------------

SPIRAL is incremental, but in phases
Spiral is risk driven, you can address the risks in different components
Its applicable to all scenarios where waterfall could be used with an additonal advantage of diffent phases
Has been around since 1998
